					<p>Milky Way Galaxy, large spiral system consisting of several hundred billion stars, one of which is the Sun. It takes its name from the Milky Way, the irregular luminous band of stars and gas clouds that stretches across the sky as seen from Earth. Although Earth lies well within the Milky Way Galaxy (sometimes simply called the Galaxy), astronomers do not have as complete an understanding of its nature as they do of some external star systems. A thick layer of interstellar dust obscures much of the Galaxy from scrutiny by optical telescopes, and astronomers can determine its large-scale structure only with the aid of radio and infrared telescopes, which can detect the forms of radiation that penetrate the obscuring matter..</p>
					<ul>
						<span>The MilkyGalaxy can be seen from the following star systems:</span>
						<li>ARCTURUS</li>
						<li>ANDROMEDA</li>
						<li>ORION and the PLEIADES</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<span>Star clusters and stellar associations: Although most stars in the Galaxy exist either as single stars like the Sun or as double stars, there are many conspicuous groups and clusters of stars that contain tens to thousands of members. These objects can be subdivided into three types: globular clusters, open clusters, and stellar associations. They differ primarily in age and in the number of member stars.</span>
						<li>Globular clusters -
		            The largest and most massive star clusters are the globular clusters, so called because of their roughly spherical appearance. The Galaxy contains more than 150 globular clusters (the exact number is uncertain because of obscuration by dust in the Milky Way band, which probably prevents some globular clusters from being seen). They are arranged in a nearly spherical halo around the Milky Way, with relatively few toward the galactic plane but a heavy concentration toward the centre. The radial distribution, when plotted as a function of distance from the galactic centre, fits a mathematical expression of a form identical to the one describing the star distribution in elliptical galaxies.</li>
						<li>Open clusters -
		            Clusters smaller and less massive than the globular clusters are found in the plane of the Galaxy intermixed with the majority of the system’s stars, including the Sun. These objects are the open clusters, so called because they generally have a more open, loose appearance than typical globular clusters.</li>
						<li>Stellar associations -
		            Even younger than open clusters, stellar associations are very loose groupings of young stars that share a common place and time of origin but that are not generally tied closely enough together gravitationally to form a stable cluster. Stellar associations are limited strictly to the plane of the Galaxy and appear only in regions of the system where star formation is occurring, notably in the spiral arms. They are very luminous objects. The brightest are even brighter than the brightest globular clusters, but this is not because they contain more stars; instead it is the result of the fact that their constituent stars are very much brighter than the stars constituting globular clusters. The most luminous stars in stellar associations are very young stars of spectral types O and B. They have absolute luminosities as bright as any star in the Galaxy—on the order of one million times the luminosity of the Sun. Such stars have very short lifetimes, only lasting a few million years. With luminous stars of this type there need not be very many to make up a highly luminous and conspicuous grouping. The total masses of stellar associations amount to only a few hundred solar masses, with the population of stars being in the hundreds or, in a few cases, thousands.</li>

					<header>MilkyGalaxy and AndromedaGalaxy</header>
					<p>Our galaxy, the Milky Way, has collided with another galaxy, called Andromeda. Although the two galaxies are passing through each other at a million miles an hour, the whole process will take many millions of years to complete. And when everything settles down, the two galaxies will have merged into one.</p>
					<p>The students fear that this may be the end of life, as they know it. But, their teacher reassures her class that there is very little chance of stars from the Andromeda galaxy hitting the Sun or the Earth. Even though the galaxies pass clear through each other, she says, stars in a galaxy are spaced very far apart.</p>
					<p>They are like grains of sand separated by the length of a football field. The Andromeda stars simply pass by. But galaxies are more than just stars. They contain giant clouds of gas and dust. And, when galaxies collide, these clouds smash into one another. The clouds contain the raw materials needed to make new stars. It is the collision between clouds that has triggered a starry baby boom!</p>

					<p>To travel the multiverse, you can start by creating your first spaceship and travelling portal code:</p>
					<code>
	function createStarship( yourStarship ) {

			alert( "Starship" + portal );

	}

	multiverse( "World" );

				<section class="main-section" id="Moving_Groups">
					<header>Moving Groups</header>
					<p>These objects are organizations of stars that share common measurable motions. Sometimes these do not form a noticeable cluster. This definition allows the term to be applied to a range of objects from the nearest gravitationally bound clusters to groups of widely spread stars with no apparent gravitational identity, which are discovered only by searching the catalogs for stars of common motion. Among the best known of the moving groups is the Hyades in the 							constellation Taurus. Also known as the Taurus moving cluster or the Taurus stream, this system comprises the relatively dense Hyades cluster along with a few very distant members. It contains a total of about 350 stars, including several white dwarfs.</p>
					<p>One of the basic problems of using moving groups for distance determination is the selection of members. In the case of the Hyades, this has been done very carefully but not without considerable dispute. The members of a moving group (and its actual existence) are established by the degree to which their motions define a common convergent point in the sky.</p>
					<p>As radial velocities will not have been used for the preliminary selection of members, they can be subsequently examined to eliminate further nonmembers.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="main-section" id="Angular_Distance">
					<header>Angular Distance</header>
					<p>If the angular distance of a star from the radiant is λ and if the velocity of the cluster as a whole with respect to the Sun is V, then the radial velocity of the star, Vr, is:</p>
					<code>
	Vr= V cos λ
					</code>
					<p>The transverse (or tangential) velocity, T, is given by</p>
					<code>
	T = V sin λ = 4.74 μ/p
					</code>
					<p>where p is the star’s parallax in arc seconds. Thus, the parallax of a star is given by</p>
					<code>
	p = 4.74 μ cot λ/Vr.
					</code>
					<p>The key to achieving reliable distances by this method is to locate the convergent point of the group as accurately as possible.</p>

				<section class="main-section" id="Emission_Nebulae">
					<header>Emission Nebulae</header>
					<p>A conspicuous component of the Galaxy is the collection of large, bright, diffuse gaseous objects generally called nebulae. The brightest of these cloudlike objects are the emission nebulae, large complexes of interstellar gas and stars in which the gas exists in an ionized and excited state (with the electrons of the atoms excited to a higher than normal energy level). This condition is produced by the strong ultraviolet light emitted from the very luminous, hot stars embedded in the gas. Because emission nebulae consist almost entirely of ionized hydrogen, they are usually referred to as H II regions.</p>
					<p>H II regions are found in the plane of the Galaxy intermixed with young stars, stellar associations, and the youngest of the open clusters. They are areas where very massive stars have recently formed, and many contain the uncondensed gas, dust, and molecular complexes commonly associated with ongoing star formation. The H II regions are concentrated in the spiral arms of the Galaxy, though some exist between the arms. Many of them are found at intermediate distances from the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the largest number occurring at a distance of 10,000 light-years. This latter fact can be ascertained even though the H II regions cannot be seen clearly beyond a few thousand light-years from the Sun. They emit radio radiation of a characteristic type, with a thermal spectrum that indicates that their temperatures are about 10,000 kelvins. This thermal radio radiation enables astronomers to map the distribution of H II regions in distant parts of the Galaxy.</p>

		var x = Multiverse;

	}

	EMC=2(x); Einstein
					</code>
					<p>The largest and brightest H II regions in the Galaxy rival the brightest star clusters in total luminosity. Even though most of the visible radiation is concentrated in a few discrete emission lines, the total apparent brightness of the brightest is the equivalent of tens of thousands of solar luminosities. </p>

				<section class="main-section" id="Planetary_Nebulae">
				<header>Planetary Nebulae</header>
				<p>The gaseous clouds known as planetary nebulae are only superficially similar to other types of nebulae. So called because the smaller varieties almost resemble planetary disks when viewed through a telescope, planetary nebulae represent a stage at the end of the stellar life cycle rather than one at the beginning. </p>
				<p>The distribution of such nebulae in the Galaxy is different from that of H II regions. Planetary nebulae belong to an intermediate population and are found throughout the disk and the inner halo. There are more than 1,000 known planetary nebulae in the Galaxy, but more might be overlooked because of obscuration in the Milky Way region.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="main-section" id="Supernova_Remnants">
				<header>Supernova Remnants</header>
				<p>Another type of nebulous object found in the Galaxy is the remnant of the gas blown out from an exploding star that forms a supernova. Occasionally these objects look something like planetary nebulae, as in the case of the Crab Nebula, but they differ from the latter in three ways:</p>
				<code>
(1) the total mass of their gas (they involve a larger mass, essentially all the mass of the exploding star),
(2) their kinematics (they are expanding with higher velocities),
(3) their lifetimes (they last for a shorter time as visible nebulae).
				</code>
				<p>The best-known supernova remnants are those resulting from three historically observed supernovae: that of 1054, which made the Crab Nebula its remnant; that of 1572, called Tycho’s Nova; and that of 1604, called Kepler’s Nova.</p>
				<p>These objects and the many others like them in the Galaxy are detected at radio wavelengths. They release radio energy in a nearly flat spectrum because of the emission of radiation by charged particles moving spirally at nearly the speed of light in a magnetic field enmeshed in the gaseous remnant.</p>
				<p>Radiation generated in this way is called synchrotron radiation and is associated with various types of violent cosmic phenomena besides supernova remnants, as, for example, radio galaxies.</p>

	function f() {
	g =^*
	g><*

				<section class="main-section" id="Dusty_Clouds">
				<header>Dusty Clouds</header>
				<p>The dust clouds of the Galaxy are narrowly limited to the plane of the Milky Way, though very low-density dust can be detected even near the galactic poles.
					EXAMPLES CAN BE:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<ul>
							<span>Six types of dusty clouds:</span>
							<li>MUNIRU</li>
							<li>HILARION</li>
							<li>CLAUDIA</li>
							<li>ARCTURIA</li>
							<li>FAVVYLAVVY</li>
							<li>MARVYSERVVY</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>and FUCKSEX</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Although these clouds are baby clouds, but in trillion of years to come in earth terms, they will be full blown baby planets thereby forming another solar system or even part of a conglomerate galaxy of galaxia.</p>
